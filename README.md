## Scripts for an Automated, Large-Scale Fax Survey Campaign using Python, docx-mailmerge, and Phaxio

Faxing is still surprisingly common in many business, especially in medicine. As a result, when you're considering doing a survey or reaching a lot of businesses for some other purpose, fax is an option to consider.

However, fax can be very labour intensive. For example, suppose you’re conducting a survey of businesses and the only contact information is a fax number. Let’s say you have 5,000 people in your sample and each survey has unique information for each respondent (for example, their name or a unique ID value to track responses).

Luckily, there is a much better alternative: programmable fax APIs. This code gives an example of how to use one of these services called Phaxio to send out faxes for a hypothetical survey campaign. Here’s the scenario:

* You have a sample of potential respondents in a CSV file that you want to fax information to which includes their fax number, name, address, and ID.

* You have a template in a word document of the survey that you want to send. The survey needs to be slightly different for each person in the sample, including their particular name, address, and ID.
